# HumanEval/152

Benchmark: humaneval+. Run: `q8b-test-v1`. Back to the [index](../../README.md).

## Attempts

"Hidden tests" is the result of the attempt's final code on the full EvalPlus suite, without frontier help. ⚠️ marks code that passed the visible tests but fails the hidden tests: the case the routers try to catch.

| Attempt | Rounds | End | Hidden tests (final code) | Thinking tokens per round | Cap hits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Attempt 0](attempt_0.md) | 1 | visible pass | ✅ pass | 1368 | 0 |
| [Attempt 1](attempt_1.md) | 1 | visible pass | ✅ pass | 1250 | 0 |
| [Attempt 2](attempt_2.md) | 1 | visible pass | ✅ pass | 1684 | 0 |
| [Attempt 3](attempt_3.md) | 1 | visible pass | ✅ pass | 1045 | 0 |
| [Attempt 4](attempt_4.md) | 1 | visible pass | ✅ pass | 1632 | 0 |

## Prompt shown to the model (round 1)

```python

def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """

Visible tests:
