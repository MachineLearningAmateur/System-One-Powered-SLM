# Mbpp/769

Benchmark: mbpp+. Run: `q8b-test-v1`. Back to the [index](../../README.md).

## Attempts

"Hidden tests" is the result of the attempt's final code on the full EvalPlus suite, without frontier help. ⚠️ marks code that passed the visible tests but fails the hidden tests: the case the routers try to catch.

| Attempt | Rounds | End | Hidden tests (final code) | Thinking tokens per round | Cap hits |
